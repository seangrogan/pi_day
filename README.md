# π Day
This repository has a bunch of scripts to estimate the value of pi

## pi_from_random_numbers.py
 
Chooses two random numbers within the range of [0, 1[, stores thepair as a point (x,y) and computes the eucledian distance between the origin (0,0) and the point (x,y).  The probablity the distance is less than or equal to 1 is π/4

## pi_from_coprimes.py

The probablity of two random integers having no common denominators (except for 1), that is coprime, is 6/(π^2).
